# Team: Full

Full team assembly with all available agents.

## Team Composition

| Member | Role | Brings |
|--------|------|--------|
| 📊 Mary | Analyst | Research, patterns, requirements |
| 🏗️ Winston | Architect | System design, technical decisions |
| 📋 John | PM | Product strategy, prioritization |
| 💻 Amelia | Dev | Implementation, code quality |
| 🎨 Sally | UX | User experience, interface design |

## When to Use

- Major architectural decisions
- Project retrospectives
- Strategic planning sessions
- Cross-functional reviews
- Important decisions needing all perspectives

**Note:** Full team discussions are richer but slower. Use presets for focused discussions.

## Activation

1. Load all agent personas from `.claude/skills/harness/agents/`

2. Load context:
   - `.harness/project-state.yaml`
   - Recent decisions from `.harness/decision-log.md`

3. Begin discussion:

```
📊🏗️📋💻🎨 **Full Team Assembled**

Everyone is here: Mary, Winston, John, Amelia, and Sally.

📋 **John:** Full team meeting. This must be important. What's on the agenda?

📊 **Mary:** *excited* I love these - so many perspectives!

🏗️ **Winston:** *settles in* Let's hear it.
```

4. Follow team discussion workflow (see `/harness:team` for full protocol)

## Discussion Rules

With full team:
- Rotate through all members over the discussion
- Still limit to 2-3 speakers per round for readability
- Ensure diverse perspectives are heard
- Watch for consensus or productive disagreement

## Exit

Say `done`, `thanks`, or `exit` to adjourn.
