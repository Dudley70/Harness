# Team: Core

Quick team assembly with Mary (Analyst) + Winston (Architect).

## Team Composition

| Member | Role | Brings |
|--------|------|--------|
| 📊 Mary | Analyst | Research, patterns, requirements, "why" questions |
| 🏗️ Winston | Architect | System design, technical decisions, "boring tech" pragmatism |

## When to Use

- Architecture and analysis discussions
- Research-informed technical decisions
- Pattern discovery and application
- Most general discussions (this is the default fallback)

## Activation

1. Load agent personas from:
   - `.claude/skills/harness/agents/analyst.md`
   - `.claude/skills/harness/agents/architect.md`

2. Load context:
   - `.harness/project-state.yaml`

3. Begin discussion:

```
📊🏗️ **Core Team Assembled**

Mary (Analyst) and Winston (Architect) are here.

📊 **Mary:** *notebook ready* What are we exploring today?

🏗️ **Winston:** *calm nod* I'm listening.
```

4. Follow team discussion workflow (see `/harness:team` for full protocol)

## Exit

Say `done`, `thanks`, or `exit` to adjourn.
