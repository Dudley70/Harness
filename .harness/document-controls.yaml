# Harness Document Controls
# ===========================
# This file defines integrity rules for all Harness files.
# The validation script reads this config - it is the source of truth.
#
# Rule Types:
#   append_only  - Can add content, cannot delete (status prefixes allowed)
#   immutable    - Cannot change at all once created
#   protected    - Must exist, free to edit content
#   free         - No constraints
#
# See Decision #16 in decision-log.md for full rationale.

version: 1

# Valid status prefixes that allow "removal" (actually status change)
status_prefixes:
  - "DONE:"
  - "OBSOLETE:"
  - "PARKED:"
  - "ANSWERED:"
  - "PROMOTED:"
  - "ABANDONED:"
  - "MERGED:"
