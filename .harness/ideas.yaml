    title: "Session Lifecycle Management - Pre-Pivot Protocol"
    content: |
      Pattern observed: Sessions repeatedly get derailed by mid-session discoveries.
      Session 8: git cleanup → BMAD issues → deletions → D16/D17 (D15 interrupted).

      Proposed Pre-Pivot Protocol:
      1. Before changing focus, PARK current task in project-state.yaml
      2. Capture reason for pivot
      3. Add new focus as P0 with context

      Question: Is this a skill (session-management) or just a CLAUDE.md principle?

      Options discussed:
      A) New skill: session-management (start.md, pivot.md, end.md)
      B) Extend document-management skill
      C) Just add principle to CLAUDE.md

      Blocked on: Need to understand skill invocation architecture first (Q9-Q37)

    title: "Question/Task Tracking - Nothing Gets Lost"
    content: |
      Problem observed at Session 9 end:
      - Questions asked by Claude that user didn't answer → lost
      - Tasks implied but not explicitly tracked → lost
      - Options offered but not selected → lost
      - Open items from session start never revisited → lost

      Examples from Session 9:
      - "Merge to main?" - asked, moved on, never re-merged after more commits
      - "Should session summaries be immutable?" - asked by John, never answered
      - "Test /harness command" - offered as option, never done

      Proposed Solution - Transcript Review Enhancement:
      The transcript already captures everything. Enhance session-recovery.py to:
      1. Detect questions (? at end of Claude message)
      2. Check if next user message answered or moved on
      3. Flag unanswered questions in recovery checklist
      4. Detect "offered options" patterns (1. 2. 3. lists)
      5. Flag unselected options that might still be relevant

      Implementation could be:
      A) Enhance session-recovery.py with question/task parsing
      B) Add end-of-session audit script
      C) Add to capture-protocol.md as manual checklist
      D) Combination: auto-detect + manual review
