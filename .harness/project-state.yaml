# Session History
sessions:
  session_1:
    date: 2025-12-10
    ended_at_context: "83% (166k/200k) - RED zone, session ended proactively"
    key_accomplishments:
      - "Project initialized with governance structure"
      - "Working agreement with validated sub-agent learnings"
      - "Vision document created (at 102% - emergency capture)"
      - "Lean research: 23 patterns extracted"
    lessons_learned:
      - "L1: Sub-agent output MUST write to files"
      - "L2: State docs capture WHAT not WHY"
      - "L3: 'Documented everything' is dangerous assumption"
      - "L4: Emergency captures indicate process failure"

  session_2:
    date: 2025-12-10
    focus: "Transcript analysis and capture protocol"
    key_accomplishments:
      - "Discovered sessions persist to ~/.claude/projects/ as JSONL"
      - "Session 1 transcript (166KB) recovered and analyzed"
      - "Gap analysis: identified undocumented insights from transcript"
      - "Created Capture & Documentation Protocol"
      - "Updated working-agreement with Claude Code vs Desktop comparison"
      - "Embedded capture as CORE methodology requirement"
    key_decisions:
      - "D7: Transcripts are essential memory - must be captured"
      - "D8: End-of-session checklist is MANDATORY"
      - "D9: Capture protocol is foundation of Harness, not add-on"
    new_learnings:
      - "JSONL sessions contain ~7x more than readable markdown"
      - "Human-readable content: ~128KB; Tool overhead: ~397KB"
      - "Claude Desktop history survives CLI reset"
      - "Transcript mining can recover undocumented insights"

next_session_actions:
