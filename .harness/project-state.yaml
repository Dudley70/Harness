# Session History
sessions:
  session_1:
    date: 2025-12-10
    ended_at_context: "83% (166k/200k) - RED zone, session ended proactively"
    key_accomplishments:
      - "Project initialized with governance structure"
      - "Working agreement with validated sub-agent learnings"
      - "Vision document created (at 102% - emergency capture)"
      - "Lean research: 23 patterns extracted"
    lessons_learned:
      - "L1: Sub-agent output MUST write to files"
      - "L2: State docs capture WHAT not WHY"
      - "L3: 'Documented everything' is dangerous assumption"
      - "L4: Emergency captures indicate process failure"

  session_2:
    date: 2025-12-10
    focus: "Transcript analysis and capture protocol"
    key_accomplishments:
      - "Discovered sessions persist to ~/.claude/projects/ as JSONL"
      - "Session 1 transcript (166KB) recovered and analyzed"
      - "Gap analysis: identified undocumented insights from transcript"
      - "Created Capture & Documentation Protocol"
      - "Updated working-agreement with Claude Code vs Desktop comparison"
      - "Embedded capture as CORE methodology requirement"
    key_decisions:
      - "D7: Transcripts are essential memory - must be captured"
      - "D8: End-of-session checklist is MANDATORY"
      - "D9: Capture protocol is foundation of Harness, not add-on"
    new_learnings:
      - "JSONL sessions contain ~7x more than readable markdown"
      - "Human-readable content: ~128KB; Tool overhead: ~397KB"
      - "Claude Desktop history survives CLI reset"
      - "Transcript mining can recover undocumented insights"

  session_3:
    date: 2025-12-11
    focus: "Recovery system enhancement and document governance"
    key_accomplishments:
      - "Enhanced session-recovery.py with progressive disclosure format"
      - "Added session profile, files touched, priority checklist to transcripts"
      - "BMAD Master updated with recovery-check, deep-recovery, run-recovery menus"
      - "Created document-index.md defining document purposes"
      - "Removed duplication: working-agreement.md now references vision.md"
      - "Added decision-sync check to recovery script"
      - "Synced vision.md with Session 2 & 3 principles"
    key_decisions:
      - "D10: Recovery Handoff Protocol - hook lightweight, Master does full restore"
      - "D11: BMAD Master as default entry point for all interactions"
      - "D12: Each document has ONE purpose, no duplication"
    new_learnings:
      - "Claude Code hooks: SessionStart, SessionEnd, Stop, PreCompact, PostToolUse available"
      - "Party mode loads ALL agent personas (~4,500 tokens) - sunk cost once loaded"
      - "PostToolUse can target specific file edits (Edit|Write matcher)"
      - "Single JSONL per project, cumulative across sessions"
    context_at_end: "82% - ORANGE zone"

next_session_actions:
  - "P0: Design Harness information architecture (sitemap/master index for LLM navigation)"
  - "P0: Define standard document template with progressive disclosure structure"
  - "P1: Define Pattern Extraction Schema for methodology research"
  - "P1: Create research plan document with methodology assignments"
  - "P1: Git/GitHub management UX - visual branch status, guided workflows, auto-push"
  - "P2: Begin methodology research (sub-agents write directly to files)"
  - "P2: Consider PreCompact/SessionEnd hooks setup"
  - "PARKED: LLM-optimized document format - see /Users/dudley/projects/Compression/"

improvement_ideas:
  git_github_ux:
    problem: "Easy to forget push, hard to see branch state, no guided workflow"
    needs:
      - "Visual display of branches and their status (ahead/behind, uncommitted changes)"
      - "Guided workflow: commit → push → PR (when appropriate)"
      - "Human-readable status summary (not just git output)"
      - "Auto-push option on session end (SessionEnd hook?)"
      - "Branch management guidance (when to branch, when to merge)"
    possible_approaches:
      - "BMAD Master 'git-status' menu item with formatted output"
      - "SessionEnd hook that shows status + prompts for push"
      - "Custom script that renders visual branch tree"
      - "Integration with gh CLI for PR status"

  llm_compression:
    location: "/Users/dudley/projects/Compression/"
    key_file: "readme.md"
    status: "Completed project from earlier - needs thorough testing before use"
    note: "User's first Claude Code skill - may need updates for current environment"
    relevance: "77% compression with 100% sacred content preservation"
    key_insights:
      - "Pure LLM compression failed 5/5 times - architectural separation required"
      - "Sacred content (code, formulas, prompts) physically extracted before LLM processing"
      - "Placeholder system: {{SACRED_TEST_PROMPT_0}} preserves references"
      - "Hybrid pipeline: Extract → LLM compress → Restore → Validate"
      - "Principle: Structure prevents loss, not prompts or discipline"
    harness_application:
      - "Context anchors = sacred content (NEVER compress)"
      - "Progressive disclosure = hybrid pipeline layers"
      - "Document structure could use placeholder/reference patterns"
      - "V7 abbreviation rules for LLM-optimized format"
