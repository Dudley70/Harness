  description: "AI-Native Development Methodology - Channeling AI power through human-designed controls"
  repository: https://github.com/Dudley70/Harness
  created: 2025-12-10

current_phase: Architecture-Design

current_focus:
  task: "Skills-based context system design"
  status: architecture_decided
  details: "D12 approved: Harness replaces BMAD with Skills-based architecture. Ready to prototype."

# Session History
# NOTE: "Sessions" here are substantive WORK sessions (human-numbered 1, 2, 3...)
# The system also has 16+ TRANSCRIPTS (every time SessionStart hook fired).
# Transcripts include micro-tests, debug sessions, etc.
# Use atoms.jsonl to query all transcripts; use this file for work session summaries.

      - "Vision document created (at 102% - emergency capture)"
      - "Lean research: 23 patterns extracted"
    lessons_learned:
      - "L1: Sub-agent output MUST write to files"
      - "L2: State docs capture WHAT not WHY"
      - "L3: 'Documented everything' is dangerous assumption"
      - "L4: Emergency captures indicate process failure"

  session_2:
    date: 2025-12-10
    focus: "Transcript analysis and capture protocol"
    key_accomplishments:
      - "Discovered sessions persist to ~/.claude/projects/ as JSONL"

      - "D7: Transcripts are essential memory - must be captured"
      - "D8: End-of-session checklist is MANDATORY"
      - "D9: Capture protocol is foundation of Harness, not add-on"
    new_learnings:
      - "JSONL sessions contain ~7x more than readable markdown"
      - "Human-readable content: ~128KB; Tool overhead: ~397KB"

      - "Synced vision.md with Session 2 & 3 principles"
    key_decisions:
      - "D10: Recovery Handoff Protocol - hook lightweight, Master does full restore"
      - "D11: BMAD Master as default entry point for all interactions"
      - "D12: Each document has ONE purpose, no duplication"
    new_learnings:
      - "Claude Code hooks: SessionStart, SessionEnd, Stop, PreCompact, PostToolUse available"
      - "Party mode loads ALL agent personas (~4,500 tokens) - sunk cost once loaded"
      - "PostToolUse can target specific file edits (Edit|Write matcher)"
      - "Single JSONL per project, cumulative across sessions"
    context_at_end: "82% - ORANGE zone"

  session_4:
    date: 2025-12-11
    focus: "Persistent context architecture research and design"
    key_accomplishments:
      - "Fixed SessionStart hook for worktrees (moved to global ~/.claude/settings.json)"
      - "Diagnosed recovery system - hook works but only bridges to NEXT session"

  session_5:
    date: 2025-12-12
    focus: "Knowledge extraction system - taxonomy, atoms, retrospective"
    key_accomplishments:
      - "Reviewed all 16 session transcripts systematically"
      - "Created taxonomy.yaml - 10 core types, 5 domain types, DIKW maturity model"
      - "Built extract-atoms.py - processes transcripts to atoms.jsonl"
      - "Extracted 267 atoms from historical sessions"
      - "Updated vision.md - corrected Harness positioning (NOT child of BMAD)"
      - "Created ideas.yaml (8 ideas) and questions.yaml (10 questions)"
      - "Documented retrospective process in .harness/docs/"
      - "Captured 8 open questions (Q1-Q8) for future sessions"
    key_decisions:
      - "Atoms are the knowledge unit (not sessions)"
      - "Multi-type classification (atoms can have multiple types)"
      - "DIKW maturity model: extracted → synthesized → principled"
      - "RESEARCH promoted from domain to core type"
    new_learnings:
      - "Session classification types: MICRO_TEST, DEBUG, DEVOPS, RESEARCH, WORK, DISCUSSION"
      - "Types = structural (what kind), Keywords = content (what about)"
      - "Ideas/questions need lifecycle tracking (captured → exploring → promoted)"
      - "Context is not linear - autocompact frees space as you go"

  git_github_ux:
    problem: "Easy to forget push, hard to see branch state, no guided workflow"
    needs:
      - "Visual display of branches and their status (ahead/behind, uncommitted changes)"
      - "Guided workflow: commit → push → PR (when appropriate)"
      - "Human-readable status summary (not just git output)"
      - "Auto-push option on session end (SessionEnd hook?)"
      - "Branch management guidance (when to branch, when to merge)"
    possible_approaches:
      - "BMAD Master 'git-status' menu item with formatted output"
      - "SessionEnd hook that shows status + prompts for push"
      - "Custom script that renders visual branch tree"
      - "Integration with gh CLI for PR status"

    note: "User's first Claude Code skill - may need updates for current environment"
    relevance: "77% compression with 100% sacred content preservation"
    key_insights:
      - "Pure LLM compression failed 5/5 times - architectural separation required"

      - "Principle: Structure prevents loss, not prompts or discipline"
    harness_application:
      - "Context anchors = sacred content (NEVER compress)"
      - "Progressive disclosure = hybrid pipeline layers"
      - "Document structure could use placeholder/reference patterns"
