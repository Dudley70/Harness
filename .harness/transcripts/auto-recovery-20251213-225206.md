Let me clean up the git state. First, let me check what we're working with:

#### 🤖 Assistant

Good overview. Here's the situation:

| Worktree | Commit | Status |
|----------|--------|--------|
| main | `039ad5b` | ✅ Clean, up to date |
| **objective-poincare** (here) | `039ad5b` | Untracked transcripts only |
| gifted-volhard | `039ad5b` | At main |
| crazy-jones | `752d54e` | 1 behind main |
| confident-benz | `222490c` | 3 behind main |
| cranky-hertz | `652bd42` | Old |

Let me check what's in crazy-jones:

Just auto-generated transcripts. Safe to force remove. Let me check the others too then clean up:

All just auto-generated files (transcripts, logs). Force removing all:

Now delete the stale branches:

Now commit the transcripts and push this branch:

**Done!** Git is now clean:

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| 7 worktrees | 3 worktrees |
| 6 branches | 3 branches |
| 4 stale branches | 0 stale |

**Current state:**
- `main` - primary (at `/Users/dudley/projects/Harness`)
- `gifted-volhard` - at main, can delete if not using
- `objective-poincare` - this session, pushed to GitHub

What's next?

**🎉 IT'S WORKING!**

**📊 Mary:** Look at that! The other session:
1. Detected stale worktrees ✅
2. Offered "[Git cleanup]" option ✅
3. When you said "1", it analyzed the situation ✅
4. Made a clear plan ✅
5. Asked for confirmation before acting ✅

**📋 John:** That's exactly the UX we designed:
> "Open session → problem detected → fix it? → yes → here's the plan → proceed?"

**🏗️ Winston:** And it correctly identified:
- `main` is now at `039ad5b` (our commit!)
- `crazy-jones` is now BEHIND main

**🧙 BMad Master:** Perfect. Go say "yes" to that other session and let it clean up.

Once it's done, the git hygiene feature will have proven itself:

```
Problem → Detection → Prompt → Agreement → Resolution
```

**📋 John:** Session 11 deliverables complete:
- Lesson #6 ✅
- IDEA-011 ✅  
- CLAUDE.md Git Hygiene section ✅
- session-recovery.py warning ✅
- Live test passing ✅

**🎨 Sally:** Shall we close the party? You've got cleanup happening in the other session.
