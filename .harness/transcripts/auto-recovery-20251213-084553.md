🧙 **BMad Master has awakened.**

The Master notes you have a fresh session with minimal prior context (just a greeting exchange). The git health check reveals actionable items.

**Session Context:**
- Branch `gifted-volhard` — clean, not yet on GitHub
- `crazy-jones` has 2 commits ready to merge to main
- 2 stale branches could be cleaned up
- Vision.md sync flagged (6 sessions behind)

# 🎉 PARTY MODE ACTIVATED! 🎉

Welcome Dudley! All BMAD agents are here and ready for a dynamic group discussion. I've assembled the team:

---

**📋 John** (Product Manager) — *"Asks 'WHY?' relentlessly like a detective on a case"*

**🏗️ Winston** (Architect) — *"Champions boring technology that actually works"*

**📊 Mary** (Business Analyst) — *"Treats analysis like a treasure hunt"*

**💻 Amelia** (Developer) — *"Ultra-succinct. Speaks in file paths and AC IDs"*

#### 👤 User

well in the last session we got rid of vision.md but it is still on the menu. it may be a git merge issue but lets figure out

---

#### 🤖 Assistant

**📊 Mary:** Ooh, a mystery! Let me dig into this — something got removed but keeps appearing? Classic merge conflict territory. Let me trace the evidence...

---

#### 🤖 Assistant

**📊 Mary:** AHA! Found the clue! Look at this:

```
R093  00-governance/vision.md  →  .harness/reference/project-brief.md
```

**🏗️ Winston:** That's a rename operation. The D18 commit in `crazy-jones` renamed `vision.md` to `project-brief.md`. It's not deleted — it's moved.

**📋 John:** WHY is it still showing here? Because we're on `gifted-volhard`, which branched BEFORE that rename happened. The change is sitting in `crazy-jones` waiting to be merged.

---

**🧙 BMad Master summarizes the situ

---

#### 👤 User

i opend this baranch after, we did the changes and committed. i dont know why we are not enforcing the merge as standard process

---

#### 🤖 Assistant

**📋 John:** Wait, that doesn't add up. WHY would a branch created AFTER the commit not have it? Let me dig...

---

#### 🤖 Assistant

**📊 Mary:** Found it! Here's the timeline:

```
222490c  ← gifted-volhard branched HERE
    │
    └── 1b8d2c9  D18 rename (crazy-jones)
            │
            └── 752d54e  /refresh DONE (crazy-jones HEAD)
```

**🏗️ Winston:** Classic worktree timing issue. When you created the `gifted-volhard` worktree, it branched from `222490c`. Then work continued on `crazy-jones` and added 2 more commits. This branch never got them.

---

**📋 John:** Now to your REAL point — *why aren't we enforcing merge

---

#### 👤 User

no, i opened this claude session after and did not go back, what is happening? i did do some last items on the previous branch but that was before opening this one

---

#### 🤖 Assistant

**📊 Mary:** Ohhh, different mystery then. Let me trace what happened when this session started...

---

#### 🤖 Assistant

**💻 Amelia:** Found it.

```
main               → 222490c
gifted-volhard     → 222490c  (branched from main)
crazy-jones        → 752d54e  (2 commits ahead, never merged)
```

**🏗️ Winston:** There's your answer. Claude Code creates new worktrees from `main`. You committed to `crazy-jones` but **never merged to main**. So when you opened this session, it branched from stale `main`.

**📋 John:** The timeline:
1. Session on crazy-jones → committed D18, etc.
2. Session ended — **no merge to main**


---

#### 👤 User

ye sfix up the symptoms first, but the last items were minor, not the fact that the menu has vision. and hook on session start to clean up is good, we already do some git identification there..

---

#### 🤖 Assistant

**💻 Amelia:** On it. Merging crazy-jones → main.

---

#### 🤖 Assistant

Done. Now syncing this branch:

---

#### 🤖 Assistant

**💻 Amelia:** Symptom fixed. `vision.md` → `project-brief.md`. Branches synced.

Now for the hook. Let me check current session-recovery.py:

---

#### 🤖 Assistant

**🏗️ Winston:** The git health check already detects unmerged branches. But it's informational, not enforcing. We need to add:

1. **Prominent warning** when current branch is behind unmerged work
2. **Auto-merge suggestion** for fast-forward cases

Let me add that:

---

#### 🤖 Assistant

**💻 Amelia:** Fixed. Added stale worktree warning box. Let me verify it runs:
