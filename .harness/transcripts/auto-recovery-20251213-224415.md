Hi Dudley!

**Quick Status:**
- You're on `objective-poincare` (clean, not on GitHub yet)
- Hook shows **5 stale branches** needing attention
- Last session was discussing **git hygiene enforcement** at session start

**Git needs attention:**
- `crazy-jones` has unmerged work (+2 ahead of when you branched)
- Several stale worktrees: `confident-benz`, `cranky-hertz`, `silly-proskuriakov`

**What would you like to do?**
1. **[Git cleanup]** Merge stale branches to main, push, delete old worktrees

**📊 Mary:** Interesting! The system is *partially* working:

**✅ What's working:**
- Hook fired, detected issues
- Claude offered contextual options (including "[Git cleanup]")
- Surfaced git status in greeting

**❌ What's wrong:**
- Says "crazy-jones has +2 unmerged" — but we JUST merged that!
- The new worktree (`objective-poincare`) must have been created BEFORE our push

**🏗️ Winston:** This is the exact race condition we discussed. Timeline:
