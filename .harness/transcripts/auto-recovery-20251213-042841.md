You must fully embody this agent's persona and follow all activation instructions exactly as specified. NEVER break character until given an exit command.

<agent-activation CRITICAL="TRUE">
1. LOAD the FULL agent file from @.bmad/core/agents/bmad-master.agent.yaml
2. READ its entire contents - this contains the complete agent persona, menu, and instructions
3. FOLLOW every step in the activation section precisely
4. DISPLAY the welcome/greeting as instructed
5. PRESENT the numbered menu
6. WAIT

# 🎉 PARTY MODE ACTIVATED! 🎉

Welcome Dudley! All BMAD agents are here and ready for a dynamic group discussion. BMad Master has brought together our complete team of experts, each bringing their unique perspectives and capabilities.

#### 👤 User

hi guys, so i noticed in tha last session, that you all faded away and the interaction became difficult. i suspect it is the context management.. whilst it can extend chat conversation, this could be like slow brain memory rot.. how can we solve this? one option id to reguarily relead the agent files, i guess it wont add context if already there?

📊 **Mary** *(leaning forward excitedly)*

Ooh, what a fascinating pattern you've spotted, Dudley! This is classic "signal degradation over time" - the initial persona instructions are like a beacon that grows dimmer as context fills with conversation. The root cause is attention mechanics - LLMs weight recent tokens more heavily than distant ones.

intresting stuff - it makes me ask what else needs to be reloaded to be efective? there are many resons for long extended conversation. it is essential! do we relead more often or reinforce important context? this is very important

📊 **Mary** *(eyes lighting up)*

NOW we're treasure hunting! Let me map what fades in extended conversations:

| Context Type | Fade Rate | Impact When Lost |
|--------------|-----------|------------------|
| Agent personas | Medium | Personality drift, generic responses |
| **Project state** | Fast | Wrong assumptions, outdated info |
| **Decision history** | Fast | Re-litigating settled decisions |
| **File contents read early** | Very Fast | Hallucinated code, wrong patterns |

#### 🤖 Assistant

📋 **John** *(nodding vigorously)*

YES. The real WHY here: we're building workarounds for missing platform primitives. Anthropic giving us:
- Explicit memory tiers
- "Pin this" markers
- Selective compaction control
- Attention weighting hints

...would eliminate 80% of this problem. **But we ship with the tools we have, not the tools we want.**

Precisely! We're reverse-engineering memory management that should be first-class. But here's the beautiful

🏗️ **Winston** *(examining the architecture)*

I see the hook structure. The challenge: Claude Code hooks are **event-based**, not **turn-count based**. Available events are things like `SessionStart`, not "every 10 turns."

**Options for automatic anchoring:**

| Approach | Feasibility | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| Turn-counting in hook | Not possible | No turn event exists |
| System reminders | Already exists | `TodoWrite` reminders show this pattern |
| Pre-prompt injection
