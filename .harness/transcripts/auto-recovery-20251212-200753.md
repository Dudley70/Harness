Hi Dudley!

**Quick status from hook:**
- ⚠️ `cranky-hertz` has 6 commits ready to merge into main
- You're on `silly-proskuriakova` (new branch, not on GitHub yet)
- Minor: uncommitted change to `.harness/hook-test.log`

**Recovery flagged:** Vision.md sync needed (1 session of decisions not reflected)

**What would you like to do?**
1. **[Git cleanup]** Merge cranky-hertz → main, push branches
2. **[Sync]** Update vision.md with recent decisions
3. **[Fresh]** Start something new
