**📊 Mary:** Oh, you're asking about my investigative process! Let me trace those steps:

1. **agent-manifest.csv** - The party-mode workflow says to load agents from a CSV manifest. It didn't exist (the project hasn't generated one yet).

2. **`.bmad/**/agents/*.md`** - Searched for agent definition files as markdown. Found docs, not agents.

3. **`.bmad/**/agents/*.yaml`** - Found the actual agent definitions! 21 YAML files.

4. **The bash loop failure** - I tried:
   ```bash

#### 🤖 Assistant

**📋 John:** *detective mode activated* Wait. You're right. That's the old BMAD approach - CSV manifests, workflow parsing.

**🏗️ Winston:** *nodding* D12 explicitly says: "Skills-based architecture... Claude Code native features over custom infrastructure."

The agents ARE already Skills - that's why you can invoke them via:
- `/bmad:bmm:agents:pm`
- `/bmad:bmm:agents:architect`
- etc.

**📊 Mary:** *pattern emerging* So when I went hunting for `agent-manifest.csv`, I was following the legacy BMA

**📊 Mary:** *pattern emerging* Look at this! We ALREADY have Harness-native skills:

Let me read what's there:

**📊 Mary:** *excited* LOOK! Session 9 (per project-state.yaml) already built these:

| Built | Location |
|-------|----------|
| Harness party.md | `.claude/skills/harness/workflows/party.md` |
| John (PM) | `.claude/skills/harness/agents/pm.md` |
| Mary (Analyst) | `agents/analyst.md` |
| Winston (Architect) | `agents/architect.md` |
| Amelia (Dev) | `agents/dev.md` |

**🏗️ Winston:** The bug is clear. When you invoked `/bmad:core:agents:bmad-master` → selected party-mode → it loaded the **BMAD

#### 🤖 Assistant

**💻 Amelia:** Bug. No `/harness` command. Only `/refresh`.

```
.claude/commands/
└── refresh.md    # That's all
```

project-state says `"DONE: Create /harness entry point command (Session 9)"` - but it doesn't exist.

**📋 John:** Either it was never created, or it was lost. Let me check git history:

---

#### 🤖 Assistant

**📊 Mary:** Nothing! The `/harness` command was never created. It was marked DONE prematurely.

**🧙 BMad Master:** *sighs* So here's the situation:

| What We Have | What We Don't |
|--------------|---------------|
| Harness agent Skills (4 agents) | `/harness` entry command |
| Harness party.md workflow | Harness party invocation |
| BMAD slash commands | Entry point to Harness skills |

**The entry paths today:**
1. `/bmad:core:agents:bmad-master` → BMAD party-mode → **FAILS** (needs CSV)
2. `

#### 🤖 Assistant

**Summary of investigation:**

1. ✅ Harness-native agents exist in `.claude/skills/harness/agents/`
2. ✅ Harness party.md exists in `.claude/skills/harness/workflows/`
3. ❌ `/harness` command marked "DONE" but never created
4. ❌ Party mode invoked via BMAD Master → BMAD workflow → fails on missing CSV
5. ❌ No entry point to Harness-native skills

**Shall I create the `/harness` command now?** It would:
- Show a menu of Harness capabilities
- Route to Harness agents/workflows (not BMAD)
- Ma

---

#### 🤖 Assistant

**📊 Mary:** OH! So `/harness:harness` exists - that invokes the Harness skill!

And `/harness:refresh` is the context reload command.

**🏗️ Winston:** So the entry point EXISTS. The issue is:

1. When you used `/bmad:core:agents:bmad-master` → party-mode → it went to **BMAD workflow**
2. But `/harness:harness` should go to **Harness skill**

Let me see what happens when you invoke `/harness:harness`:

**📊 Mary:** Menu added. Now `/harness:harness` → select 5 → loads `./workflows/party.md` (Harness-native).

**🏗️ Winston:** The BMAD Master party-mode still routes wrong, but that's expected - BMAD is legacy source material. The path forward is:

| Entry Point | Routes To | Status |
|-------------|-----------|--------|
| `/harness:harness` → 5 | Harness party.md | ✅ Fixed |
| `/bmad:*:bmad-master` → party | BMAD workflow | ❌ Legacy (expected) |

**🧙 BMad Master:** All fixed! Here's what we did:

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| Harness SKILL.md had no menu | Added menu with agents 1-4, workflows 5-6, utilities 7-8 |
| Party mode routed to BMAD CSV-based workflow | Menu option 5 now routes to `./workflows/party.md` |
| project-state.yaml claimed wrong file path | Corrected to reflect skill invocation `/harness:harness` |
| "persona-pm" task was redundant | Marked OBSOLETE (covered by pm.md agent) |

**📋 John:** The correct usage no

#### 👤 User

so from now on i need /harness instaed of /bmad... at start? would /harness:start or /haress:menu be better than /harness:harness? i am thinking we need to build many of these and we neen an intuative system. i see bmad islayered /bmad:core:agents:bmad-master - could that have been /bmad:core:agents:bmad-master:party ?

---

#### 🤖 Assistant

**📋 John:** *leaning forward* NOW we're talking UX design. This is exactly the kind of "WHY does it work this way" question I love.

**🎨 Sally:** *joining the party* Mind if I jump in? This is user experience territory.

**📊 Mary:** Let me analyze what we're seeing:

| Pattern | Example | Source |
|---------|---------|--------|
| Skill invocation | `/harness:harness` | `.claude/skills/harness/SKILL.md` |
| BMAD command | `/bmad:core:agents:bmad-master` | `.claude/commands/bmad/core/agents/bmad-m

---

#### 🤖 Assistant

**📊 Mary:** Look! There ARE harness commands:
- `.claude/commands/harness/harness.md` → `/harness:harness`
- `.claude/commands/harness/refresh.md` → `/harness:refresh`

So we CAN create:
- `.claude/commands/harness/start.md` → `/harness:start`
- `.claude/commands/harness/party.md` → `/harness:party`
- `.claude/commands/harness/agents/mary.md` → `/harness:agents:mary`

---

#### 🤖 Assistant

**🏗️ Winston:** *nodding* So `/harness:harness` already has a menu! Session 9 built it. The issue is just the **naming**.

**🎨 Sally:** Here's my UX recommendation:

```
CURRENT (awkward):
/harness:harness      ← redundant name

PROPOSED (intuitive):
/harness              ← main entry (if possible)
/harness:menu         ← explicit menu
/harness:party        ← shortcut to party mode
/harness:agents:mary  ← direct agent access
```

**📋 John:** Can we do just `/harness` without the `:harness`?

**💻

---

#### 👤 User

is it like a folder structure? do you have to specify the pathe, ro can you shortcut? if we have the options it would be good to have shorter, but i am worried that if we have lots there will be too many. flat is great if only a few. i like it if we can present a menu at top level, and at next level - so if you do /harness:agents - a menu appears with all the options of agents, including party mode. but if you know you can do /harness:agents:party - does that make sense? also will this manually 

---

#### 🤖 Assistant

**🏗️ Winston:** *drawing on whiteboard* Yes, it's exactly a folder structure:

```
.claude/commands/harness/
├── menu.md                    → /harness:menu
├── party.md                   → /harness:party (shortcut)
├── agents.md                  → /harness:agents (shows menu)
└── agents/
    ├── mary.md                → /harness:agents:mary
    ├── winston.md             → /harness:agents:winston
    └── ...
```

**📊 Mary:** So the pattern is:
- **Folder + `.md` file of same name** = menu at tha

#### 👤 User

i am interested in how party is a workflow. what is the workflow? how does it work? in my mind it is getting the Team toether, and i think that is a better more proffessional description, and it would be nice to select the team members, like in real life, although there may be a core group

---

#### 🤖 Assistant

**📋 John:** *pausing* That's a great challenge. What IS the workflow? Let me break it down:

**Current "Party Mode" workflow:**
```
1. Activate → Load all agent personas
2. User states topic
3. Select 2-3 relevant agents per response
4. Agents discuss, cross-talk, build on each other
5. Capture decisions
6. Exit
```

**📊 Mary:** But you're right - "party" is informal. In real organizations:

| What We Call It | What It Really Is |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| Party mode | Team discu

#### 👤 User

i like b and c, what do you all think?

---

#### 🤖 Assistant

**📊 Mary:** *treasure hunt mode* Ooh, B and C together! That's actually the richest pattern:

```
B: Smart defaults     → Intelligence
C: Presets + custom   → Convenience + Flexibility
B + C: Best of both!
```

**🏗️ Winston:** I like it. Here's how they combine:

```
/harness:team              → Analyze topic, suggest team, allow override
/harness:team:core         → Preset: Mary + Winston (quick, no questions)
/harness:team:product      → Preset: John + Sally
/harness:team:technical    → Preset
