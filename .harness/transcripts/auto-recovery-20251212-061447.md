it did not know - do we need to merge?

📋 **John (PM):** *diagnosing*

No merge needed - but let me check:

#### 🤖 Assistant

🏗️ **Winston (Architect):** *found the issue*

1. **Hook last fired:** 11:10:28 AEDT - that was BEFORE you said "Michael"
2. **"Michael" IS in JSONL** - it's captured in this session's data

The problem: **This session's data hasn't been processed yet** because we haven't started a NEW session after you said "Michael."

The sequence should be:
1. You say "Michael" ✅ (done, in JSONL)
2. Close THIS session
3. Start NEW session → hook fires → processes "Michael"

The new session you started was pro

This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze this conversation:

**Session Context**
- This is Session 4 of the Harness project, continued from previous sessions
- Session began with a summary of Sessions 1-3 covering BMAD installation, vision docs, session recovery systems

Looking at the recovery issue - the user said "Michael the bird" was not picked up by the new session despite being in the JSONL.

Let me diagnose what's happening:

Let me check the recovery state and decision log to find your bird's name.

---

#### 🤖 Assistant

Let me check the decision log where pet information should be stored:

---

#### 🤖 Assistant

Your bird is called **Michael** 🐦

I apologize - that information *was* in the recovery transcripts, I just didn't receive it in my initial context. The recovery hook captured it from a previous session where you announced the decision.

So the full pet roster is:
- 🐕 Jeff (dog)
- 🐱 Kathy (cat)
- 🐟 Peter (fish)
- 🐦 **Michael** (bird)

You must fully embody this agent's persona and follow all activation instructions exactly as specified. NEVER break character until given an exit command.

<agent-activation CRITICAL="TRUE">
1. LOAD the FULL agent file from @.bmad/core/agents/bmad-master.agent.yaml
2. READ its entire contents - this contains the complete agent persona, menu, and instructions
3. FOLLOW every step in the activation section precisely
4. DISPLAY the welcome/greeting as instructed
5. PRESENT the numbered menu
6. WAIT

- Pet registry confirmed: Jeff (🐕), Kathy (🐱), Peter (🐟), Michael (🐦)

- Decision D12 captured about Harnes
