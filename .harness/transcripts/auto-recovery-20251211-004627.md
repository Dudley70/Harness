Done. The session-recovery script now automatically exports new content to markdown transcripts on every SessionStart.

**Summary of what's now automated:**

When you start a new session, the SessionStart hook runs `session-recovery.py` which:

1. **Scans** all Harness-related project folders in `~/.claude/projects/`
2. **Detects** new entries since last check
3. **Auto-exports** new content to `.harness/transcripts/auto-recovery-[timestamp].md`
4. **Analyzes** for potentially undocumented items
