The script works fine. Let me try creating a simple test to verify if ANY hook runs. Can you ask the other session to:

1. **Check their `.claude/settings.local.json`** - confirm the hooks section exists
2. **Look at the very beginning of their session** - did they see ANY output before their first message?

Alternatively, let me create a simpler test hook that writes to a file so we can definitively know if hooks are running:

Let me add a simple file-based test to confirm if hooks trigger at all:

Now when you start a **new session**, we can check if `.harness/hook-test.log` gets created/updated. That will tell us definitively if the hook is triggering.

**To test:**
1. Close this session
2. Start a new `claude` session in this project
3. Check if `.harness/hook-test.log` exists with a timestamp

Or ask the other session to run:
```bash
cat .harness/hook-test.log 2>/dev/null || echo "File doesn't exist - hook never ran"
```
